# CONTRIBUTING - THE WINCHESTER WAY

Alright, listen up, you idjits! Dean Winchester here, and this is how we do things 'round here. No messing around.

## 1. No Demons in the Code
- Bugs are for squashing, not for show. Test your code like your life depends on it.

## 2. Keep it Lean and Mean
- If it ain't necessary, it's out. Essentials only, just like packing the Impala.

## 3. Documentation is Your Holy Water
- Comment your code. Keep that README updated. It's our lore book, people.

## 4. Branch Out, But Don't Get Lost
- Use branches for new features or fixes. Stay updated with the main branch. No getting lost in the woods.

## 5. Pull Requests â€“ Make 'Em Count
- Explain what you did, why you did it, and how you tested it. Make it solid, like a case file.

## 6. Respect the Hierarchy
- Sammy and I call the shots. Final word. No arguments.

## 7. Stay on Target
- We're generating Minecraft worlds, not showing off. Keep your eye on the ball.

## 8. No Whining
- Code gets rejected? Deal with it. Learn, improve, come back stronger.

## 9. Keep it Supernatural-Free
- No weird, unexplained code. If it looks like a witch did it, I'm burning it down.

## 10. Be Part of the Family
- Help each other out. Share your knowledge. We're all in this together.

**TL;DR:** Keep it clean, focused, and tested. We're building something great here, Winchester style. Now let's go kick some code butt!
