## Bug Report

Alright, listen up! You found a bug, huh? Let's get to the bottom of this. No messing around.

### 1. What the Hell Happened?

Describe the issue. Keep it clear and to the point. Like you're explaining a case to Bobby.

### 2. Steps to Reproduce

How'd you run into this mess? Lay out the steps, clear as day.

1. First, I did this...
2. Then, I did that...
3. And bam, the problem showed up...

### 3. Expected Behavior

What were you expecting to happen? Don't assume I'm a mind reader.

### 4. Actual Behavior

What actually happened? Again, no beating around the bush.

### 5. Screenshots

If you got 'em, show 'em. Visuals help. It's like showing us a picture of the monster.

### 6. Environment

- **OS:** (What's your setup? Windows, macOS, Linux? Don't make me guess)
- **Python Version:** (Which version are you running?)
- **Anything Else?:** (Any other details that might be relevant. Like, were you messing with the settings?)

Anything else you think we should know? Don't hold back.
